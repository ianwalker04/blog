1. Skills and Talents <br>
I find communication to be the most important. One of the best parts of the experience for me was talking with a client and learning how to navigate what questions to ask. Another aspect of that is knowing what you can do and what you can't; it's important not to promise something that you can't fulfill. Before this project, I've never had experience when it came to working with a real client who was expecting things of me. Thus, I realized the importance of navigating that aspect of community work and developed my skill in it. <br>

2. Social, Environmental, Spiritual Need <br>
In the end, our work would primarily serve to make two peoples' lives much easier. Though it may not seem grand at first, it's important for them and important for the school that this gets done. It will also allow our clients to give a seating chart to students in a very efficient and timely manner, which is a social good for the student body and the commencement faculty. We are making an inefficient process for faculty much easier and by extension making it easier for ourselves whenever it's time for us to graduate. <br>

3. What was Challenged/Useful <br>
I confirmed that it was very difficult to work on a large-scale project like this for a client, as I thought. As someone who likes to work alone, I also realized how nice it can be to have partners who are working on different parts of the project. In fact, I fully realize how that is a necessity on larger projects like this. Of course, I found the earlier coursework in the course to be very helpful when it came to implementation. Now that I've had the experience, I think it would be an interesting challenge to work on another project for a client that requires heavy front-end and back-end interaction. <br>

4. Public Issues <br>
It's definitely opened me up to the possibilities of what kinds of things I might be able to work on. This project was relatively small-scale and for a very local purpose, so it got me thinking about what projects might benefit a very large number of people. I think it would be fun to work on a project that's for the benefit of a big community, and to be able to see how it actually helps people. It might be worth looking at other successful community websites and projects as an example.
