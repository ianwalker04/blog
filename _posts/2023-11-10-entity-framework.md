The tutorial was easiest whenever the code I added would comply, and it was a bit frustrating whenever it decided not to. It very much seems like your type of computer and what you have installed already changes how well the tutorial goes for you, as it went alright for me for the most part but other people I talked to seemed to have way more trouble. The tutorial would often ask you to import/change code that would break code in other files, which you then had to search out because the tutorial was not explicitly about what other things needed to be changed. <br>
Working in a single table was simple enough, but as expected, working with multiple tables had a lot more working parts and things to keep track of. It was a bit overwhelming at first but became easier as I continued to work with all of the tables and data. Realistically, any database I work with in the future is going to have multiple tables so it's important to get used to working with them. <br>
I feel more confident about making a Razor Pages for my client, although one of our other group members is in charge of doing that specific job. Our database will keep the student class from this lab (but with a few changes), and add a few more classes like seats as well. Our database will likely be a bit simpler, but it still contains many interworking parts.
