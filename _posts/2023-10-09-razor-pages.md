The whole tutorial for the most part was comprehensive and made sense, I tried to follow the steps closely and doing so led to a smooth process creating the website. Though I could follow the steps, it did give a whole lot of information, a lot of which went over my head. I'm sure I'll get more hands-on experience with a lot of it, but I was still a bit overwhelmed by all of the information and things I was unfamiliar with. <br>
When translating the tutorial into my own website, it was a bit annoying having to change all of the movie references to in my case, game references. It was easy to overlook and forget something, which would cause the whole website to fail to run. <br>
Both the Jekyll framework and the RazorPages framework try to make things simple for the user while most of the back-end stuff is taken care of, although I find Jekyll easier to work with overall. Jekyll is just a blog, but I feel like you could do more with RazorPages if you have the know-how to do so. <br>
After doing step 2, I feel more confident in creating a RazorPages application that fits me and my clients' needs. This type of database and application is perfect for what our team is needing to do, so I should get used to working with RazorPages more in the future.
