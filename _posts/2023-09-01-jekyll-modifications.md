Firstly, I'll start by talking about what I really like about <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. It's incredibly easy to make new posts, edit them, add stuff to them, et cetera. Everything is already here, so if I want to change something, either on a post or something else on the blog, editing it is usually fairly easy. I didn't have a super hard time with this assignment, although a few small things like images were a bit tricky and difficult to get working. It's interesting how a lot of the HTML/CSS skills carry over, but are slightly different in subtle ways because of the <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">additional languages</a> that Jekyll employs. Overall, I think I'll have a fine time with Jekyll. I'm looking forward to doing more advanced things using it, and to see what it can do.
