I did struggle a bit creating these diagrams! It was a bit confusing, but I think for the most part I'll get better at it the more I do it. The entity-relationship diagram wasn't terribly difficult, but the database schema was a bit confusing to convert to. First of all, I assumed that it would be easier. But coming up with ideas is easy, actually putting them into a diagram and having them make sense and connect with other nodes can be tricky to do; especially in the database schema. I had assumed it wouldn't be so picky about the primary and foreign keys, which are a bit confusing to get working as I wasn't very proficient in assigning them, but is something that I hope to improve on in the future. <br>
I'm fairly satisfied with the entity-relationship diagram, although it probably isn't perfect and could use some improvement in some areas. I'm still not entirely sure if I picked the three best entities to use in the scenario given. <br>
The database schema definitely needs work, although I think it works as a base outline for what we're trying to do. <br>
I think part of the problem lies in the choice of primary and foreign keys in the database schema, those would have to be improved before implementing the model because it could cause issues with the tables and data if implemented incorrectly. The entities and their relationships could also be dwelled on a little more closely as well, to try and account for any complications with the items and customers. <br>
