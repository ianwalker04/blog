This lab could be very confusing, like most other ASP.NET labs were at some point. I tried to start the lab on my own, but ran into some difficulties and went through two office hours sessions without getting it fixed. Eventually, I let Colten on our team try on his computer to see if it worked better, which it did. I got the initial web app and server creation done and the other members of the team finished the rest. I learned a lot about proper GitHub etiquette and the sort of conventions that are important when working on one common code base. Though, that can be said about the entire project. <br>
