Despite a few hiccups here and there, setting up the blog went fairly smoothly. What was new to me for the most part was working in the console. As time goes on, I feel like the less important it is to be able to know how to use the console or use terminal commands because of how streamlined computers are becoming. However, when working on things like this, it seems like it's still necessary. <br>
I struggled a bit figuring out how to get the local server to work, as I have no experience trying to do anything like that. Thankfully, with a friends help I was able to get it working in time. At the moment, I don't think there's anything that doesn't make sense although I'm sure that will change very quickly... <br>
I'm looking forward to learning how to make more high quality websites, and websites with more moving parts, both on the front and back end. I could see myself doing some more web development in the future, so learning about databases and how the web works is very interesting and important to me. 

Here's a short list of things I want to learn/deepen my knowledge of:
<ol>
    <li><a href="https://jquery.com/"> jQuery </a></li>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL"> SQL </a></li>
    <li><a href="https://getbootstrap.com/"> Bootstrap </a></li>
</ol>
